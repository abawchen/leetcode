# You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length.
# Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.

# For example, given:
# s: "barfoothefoobarman"
# words: ["foo", "bar"]

# You should return the indices: [0,9].
# (order does not matter).
